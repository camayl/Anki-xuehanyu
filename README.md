# Anki-xuehanyu
This is a flashcard deck made for the application Anki. The deck contains material learned in the courses A1.2, A1.3 and A1.4 Chinese in 2020, at the Konfuzius-Institut Frankfurt am Main. The deck will be updated in the future to contain further material for learning Mandarin Chinese. 

# About Anki
- Anki is a free and open-source flashcard program that utilizes spaced repetition. 

- Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. 
- Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. 
- The use of spaced repetition has been shown to increase rate of learning.
